![matRad](/assets/img/matrad_hat.svg){:height="10%" width="10%"} is an open source software for radiation treatment planning of intensity-modulated photon, proton, and carbon ion therapy. matRad is developed for educational and research purposes. It is entirely written in [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab).

For more information about this project check out the [matRad overview](https://github.com/e0404/matRad/wiki/documents/matRad.pdf) or watch a recodring of the matRad webinar at the brown bag medical physics seminar at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Help us fund matRad
========

The sustainable development of matRad costs time. To help us make a strong case towards our funders that we should continue to allocate resources for matRad's development in the future, please <a id="writeEmail" href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=We use matRad at ..." target="_top">do email</a> us and let us know if you are using matRad in your department. We maintain a list of current user groups in a <a id="gotoMap" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nG8_pE0RR5j1lp2iLLeBCeuwrO0&usp=sharing">custom google map</a>. This helps us to show the relevance of our work for the radiation oncology community. As we do not get detailed download statistics from Github, such information is very valuable to us. Thank you!

Also, if you are interested in irregular updates, please send us an <a href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=matRad newsletter" target="_top">email</a> to receive the matRad newsletter.

Features
========

matRad comprises

* MATLAB functions to model the entire treatment planning workflow
* Example patient data
* Physical and biological base data for all required computations

In particular we provide functionalities for

* Ray tracing
* Photon dose calculation
* Proton dose calculation
* Carbon ion dose calculation (including 3D RBE modeling)
* Inverse planning (based on physical dose and biological effect)
* Multileaf collimator sequencing
* Basic treatment plan visualization and evaluation

matRad is constantly evolving. If you are looking for a special feature do not hesitate and <a href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=matRad" target="_top">get in touch</a>.

Development team
========
matRad development is driven by the research group [Radiotherapy Optimization](https://www.dkfz.de/en/medphys/optimization_algorithms/optimization_algorithms.html) within the [Division of Medical Physics in Radiation Oncology](https://www.dkfz.de/en/medphys/) at the [German Cancer Research Center DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) in [Heidelberg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/German+Cancer+Research+Center/@49.41023,8.6730541,5129m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4797c12f081fefc5:0x21c080e0d5b438c8!8m2!3d49.4144184!4d8.6719509?hl=en). Please see our [author list](https://github.com/e0404/matRad/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) for an overview of all code contributers; also beyond there are many people supporting matRad through consulting and provision of data.

We are actively looking for beta testers that can provide external feedback on our code and developers that would like to take an active role in the future. Do not hesitate and <a href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=matRad" target="_top">get in touch</a>.

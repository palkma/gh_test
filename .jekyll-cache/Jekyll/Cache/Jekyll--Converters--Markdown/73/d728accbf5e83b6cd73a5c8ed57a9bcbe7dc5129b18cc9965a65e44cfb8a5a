I"ı<p><img src="https://rawgit.com/wiki/e0404/matRad/images/matrad_blank.svg" alt="matRad" height="10%" width="10%" /> is an open source software for radiation treatment planning of intensity-modulated photon, proton, and carbon ion therapy. matRad is developed for educational and research purposes. It is entirely written in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab">MATLAB</a>.</p>

<p>The sustainable development of matRad costs time. To help us make a strong case towards our funders that we should continue to allocate resources for matRad‚Äôs development in the future, please <a id="writeEmail" href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=We use matRad at ..." target="_top">do email</a> us and let us know if you are using matRad in your department. We maintain a list of current user groups in a <a id="gotoMap" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nG8_pE0RR5j1lp2iLLeBCeuwrO0&amp;usp=sharing">custom google map</a>. This helps us to show the relevance of our work for the radiation oncology community. As we do not get detailed download statistics from Github, such information is very valuable to us. Thank you!</p>

<p>Also, if you are interested in irregular updates, please send us an <a href="mailto:contact@matrad.org?Subject=matRad newsletter" target="_top">email</a> to receive the matRad newsletter.</p>
